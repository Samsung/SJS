# Octane Hacks

This directory has some versions of octane programs that have been ported not just to SJS, but to
the particular implementation limitations at the time of porting.  This is good enough to work on
porting, type checking, and backend issues for Octane programs, but these need to be re-ported to
remove hacks like multiplication by 1.0 and rewriting prototype constructions.
