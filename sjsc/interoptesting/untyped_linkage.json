/* This file specifies how we link entities named in the global environment file. 
 * Specifically, this file is a list of linkage entries for *variables* in the global
 * namespace, indicating whether they're boxed or not, and optionally specifying a textual rewrite,
 * for example mapping some local name to a qualified C++ name.
 * */

/* TODO: In general, the linkage file needs to specify a few additional things:
 *   - which header each entry is in (or perhaps, group entries by header file)
 *   - which .c file each primitive is in
 *
 * These will allow us to emit the necessary #include statements in the generated code, as well as
 * allowing us to compute the minimal set of .c/.cpp files for compiling a given program.  This way,
 * we could forgo compiling the stubs for the whole Tizen base library, and only build the ones used
 * in a given program.
